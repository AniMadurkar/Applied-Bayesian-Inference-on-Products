# Applied Bayesian Inference

This is the repo in accordance with these two Medium articles:
1. [Applied Bayesian Inference with PyMC3 pt.1](https://towardsdatascience.com/applied-bayesian-inference-pt-1-322b25093f62)
2. [Applied Bayesian Inference with PyMC3 pt.2](https://towardsdatascience.com/applied-bayesian-inference-with-python-pt-2-80bcd63b507e)
3. [Applied Bayesian Inference with PyMC3 and Bambi pt.3](https://animadurkar.medium.com/applied-bayesian-inference-with-pymc3-and-bambi-pt-3-d4bfb3211509)

In part 1, I introduce modeling the conditional world via Python/PyMC3 from a contrived coin flip example. In part 2, I dive deeper into Bayesian Analysis with a dataset from Kaggle. StockX's 2019 Sneaker dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/hudsonstuck/stockx-data-contest. In part part 3, I take the skills learned so far to build ML models based on Bayesian estimation to predict streams for Spotify's Top 200 songs. The dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/sashankpillai/spotify-top-200-charts-20202021
